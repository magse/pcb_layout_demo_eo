This project is a demonstration of the Extremal Optimazation techniques described in the online conference presentation during [SICFP21](https://liu.se/en/research/sicfp) on 1-2 June 2021. Please cite the [conference proceeding](https://liu.se/dfsmedia/dd35e243dfb7406993c1815aaf88a675/46357-source/options/download/sicfp21-papers) 

Some good C++ skills is needed to follow this example. Please contact me for comment, questions, suggestions or other ideas.

The project [geometry2d](https://github.com/magse/geometry2d) is needed to run this code.

Enjoy!
